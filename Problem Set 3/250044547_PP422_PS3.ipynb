    "Based on the two readings, here are the optimistic and pessimistic views on algorithms and bias:\n",
    "\n",
    "*The Optimistic View:*\n",
    "Mullainathan argues that algorithmic bias, while harmful, is actually easier to detect and fix than human bias. Unlike the painstaking work required to uncover human discrimination (like the resume study that required months of covert operations), algorithmic bias can be uncovered through straightforward statistical analysis. More importantly, once discovered, algorithmic bias can be remedied relatively quickly—the authors built a prototype fix and the algorithm manufacturer also corrected the problem independently. As Mullainathan notes, \"changing algorithms is easier than changing people: software on computers can be updated; the 'wetware' in our brains has so far proven much less pliable.\" With proper regulation and oversight, algorithms could actually help reduce discrimination by making bias visible and correctable in ways that human decision-making is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The Pessimistic View:*\n",
    "However, the readings also highlight significant concerns. The healthcare algorithm case demonstrates how seemingly reasonable choices—using healthcare costs as a proxy for health needs—can encode and amplify existing structural inequalities. Because society spends less on Black patients, the algorithm systematically underestimated their health needs, affecting millions of people. Moreover, proper regulation doesn't currently exist, and that fixing algorithms won't resolve the \"deep, structural bias that continues to plague the United States.\" The camera analogy (equipment calibrated for white skin) illustrates how algorithms can fail to account for diversity, perpetuating historical biases in new technological forms. While the algorithm itself can be fixed, it doesn't address the underlying inequalities in healthcare access and spending that created the bias in the first place."

    "The main difference between the two models lies in their use of features. While both bagging and Random Forest rely on bootstrapping to create multiple samples, the key distinction is how features are handled at each split. Bagging uses all available features for every bootstrapped sample, whereas Random Forest uses a random subset of features, which in this case is six, for each split.\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature subsampling helps decorrelate the trees. If a particular variable has a strong influence, bagging tends to produce similar trees that repeatedly assign high importance to that variable, leading to highly correlated predictions across bootstrap samples. Random Forest mitigates this issue by restricting the feature set at each split, resulting in more diverse trees and improved overall performance."

Since residuals are squared, outliers that are far from the rest of the data have a disproportionately large effect, pulling the line of best fit toward them and distorting predictions.  \n",
    "Decision trees, on the other hand, partition the data through binary splits that minimize impurity (Gini impurity for classification or SSE for regression). An outlier, no matter how extreme, simply ends up isolated in its own leaf or partition. It does not drag the rest of the predictions with it, as the splitting mechanism treats it as just another data point to be separated. A small number of outliers would not be the deciding factor in how the tree draws its decision boundaries.  \n",
