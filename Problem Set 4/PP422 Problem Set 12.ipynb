    "While presented in some prior code, a useful `sklearn` function for PCA and later analysis will be the `Pipeline`. Pipeline allows you to create a sequence of data instructions that can be applied to your data before fitting a model. It is particularly useful for ensuring your training and testing data both receive the same series of transformations. \n",

    "For example, when fitting a PCA model, we first need to standardize our data, then estimate and store the principal components ($Z_1, Z_2,\\dots, Z_m$). If we subsequently wish to use these principal components to make estimates on testing data, we need to ensure the testing data undergoes the same scaling process and that the same principal component loading factors are applied to transform the columns of the testing data. Creating a pipeline is an efficient way to control the application of these steps.\n",
